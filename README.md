# Weather Project
Flask web application that allows users to enter a city and country code to receive current weather information. It uses the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API to fetch the location's coordinates and then retrieves real-time weather data including climate and temperature in Celsius, displaying the results on a simple web page.
